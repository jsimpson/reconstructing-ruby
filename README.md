# Reconstructing Ruby

This repository serves as my effort in following the [Reconstructing Ruby](http://wwww.halogenandtoast.com/recconstructing.ruby-an-introduction) series from [halogenandtoast](http://www.halogenandtoast.com).

Like the author of the series, I, too, am intersted in the design of programming languages and Ruby in particular. Also, like the author, I've read through my copy of [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope) a few times and have wanted to play with and better understand some of the ideas presented in the book.
